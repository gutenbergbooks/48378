<p>THAT THE WORD "HEARTH" is synonymous with
"home" in many languages is not surprising since much
of the enjoyment of home and camp life centers about an
open fire. In mild climates a properly built fireplace will
heat a single room, and when equipped with a convection
heater will also heat a second room on the same floor or an
upper floor. In colder climates it is a useful adjunct to
other heating systems if provided with a damper.</p>

<p>This bulletin is intended to give the householder and
prospective builder, especially the farmer who might superintend
the construction of his home, a working knowledge of
the principles to be observed in planning and building fireplaces
and chimneys. These principles, if observed, will
make the structures useful and satisfactory and insure their
safety.</p>

<p>Safe fireplaces and chimneys that function properly can
be built by applying the principles given in this bulletin, but
a good chimney will not last indefinitely without proper care
and repair.</p>

<p>Fireplaces and chimneys, being conspicuous architectural
features, should be pleasing in appearance and conform with
the general design of the building and its surroundings.</p>

<p>This bulletin supersedes Farmers' Bulletin 1649, Construction
of Chimneys and Fireplaces.</p>

<p>FIREPLACES AND CHIMNEYS should provide a safe place for
an open fire and a flue for draft to expel smoke from the fire
passage to the open air. They must be properly designed and constructed
(<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>) if good performance and protection against fire are
to be obtained.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="Design" name="Design"></a>DESIGN</p>

<p>Solid masonry is the most satisfactory and safest material to use
for chimneys and fireplaces. If a chimney fire occurs, the safety of
the building may be dependent on the soundness of the flue walls
(<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>). Cracked and leaky flues not only are inefficient, destroying
the draft as well as permitting smoke and gases to pass into adjacent
rooms, but are a dangerous fire hazard. The chimney as known today
was developed about 600 years ago. Experience has shown that the
satisfactory performance of a chimney flue is determined by its size,
direction, shape, height, tightness, and smoothness.</p>

<p class="caption4">Draft</p>

<p>The draft of a chimney is the current of air created by the difference
in pressure resulting from variation in weight between the relatively
hot gases in the flue and the cooler outside air. The strength
or intensity of the draft depends, for the most part, on the height of
the chimney, and the temperature difference between the chimney
gases and the outside atmosphere. The draft is not so good in summer
as in winter because the difference in temperature between the
outside air and the gases in the flue is less.</p>

<p>A very common error in chimney design is failure to distinguish
between the size of the flue required for free passage of the volume of
smoke from a given amount of fuel and that which, with proper height,
will produce the required draft. A chimney may be high enough
(<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>), yet have an area too small to expel the volume of smoke; or
the size may be ample (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>) but the height not great enough to
produce a strong draft. Either fault or a combination of the two will
result in unsatisfactory service.</p>

<p class="caption4">Flue Sites</p>

<p>The dimensions of a flue for adequate draft depend principally on
the grate area and type of heating plant<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and on the kind of fuel to be
burned, both of which should be determined before construction is
begun. If a chimney is found to be inadequate the only method of
improving it, short of reconstruction, is to increase its height. This is
not always effective and is often impracticable.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Farmers' Bulletin 1698, Heating the Farm Home, contains information on estimating the size of the
heating plant needed for houses of different sizes and for determining grate areas.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#Table_1">Table 1</a> gives the sizes of fire-clay flue linings ordinarily provided
for boilers, furnaces, stoves, or convection heaters burning soft coal.
These sizes have proved satisfactory for average flat-grate furnaces
under normal conditions. Manufacturers of heating equipment
usually specify certain requirements in chimney construction and will
not guarantee the performance of their heaters unless these requirements
are met. Therefore their recommendations should be followed
when differing materially from the dimensions given in this bulletin.</p>

<p class="caption4">Height of Chimney</p>

<p>A chimney should extend at least 3 feet above flat roofs and 2 feet
above the ridge of peak roofs. Where chimneys cannot be built
high enough above the ridge to prevent trouble from eddies caused by
wind being deflected from the roof, a hood may be provided with the
open ends parallel to the ridge. Eddies which force air down the
flues may be caused by building the chimney too near trees (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5, <i>B</i></a>)
or a higher structure (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>).</p>

<p>The ratings given are based on comparatively smooth lined flues with no offsets greater than 30&deg; with
the vertical.</p>

<p>The smallest sizes of fuels require excessive drafts and may necessitate taller chimneys.</p>

<p>Flue heights and sizes are based upon approximately the several altitudes indicated; it is sufficiently
accurate to use the column giving the altitude nearest to that of the particular problem.</p>

<p>When 2 or 3 appliances are connected to the same flue their total grate area may be reduced 15 percent.
The method of determining the proper flue size for an altitude of 2,000 feet, when 1 appliance with a grate
area of 3 square feet and another with an area of 1.5 square feet are attached to the same flue, is shown by the
following example:</p>

<p>Add the 2 grate areas, 3 + 1.5 = 4.5 square feet. Reduce this total area by 15 percent. Thus, 4.5 - 0.68 = 3.8
square feet is the required area. Use the nearest whole number, 4. From the table it is seen that for a grate
area of 4 square feet at an elevation of 2,000 feet either a 12-inch (inside diameter) round flue or a 13- by
13-inch (outside dimensions) rectangular flue 37 feet high is required.</p></blockquote>

<p class="caption4">Supporting the Chimney</p>

<p>Stable foundations, preferably of concrete, should be provided, at
least 6 inches wider all around than the chimney and 8 inches thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
for one-story and 12 inches thick for two-story houses. When there
is no basement or cellar (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7, <i>A</i></a>), start the foundation of an exterior
chimney well below the frost line; otherwise, extend the base to the
same level as the bottom of the foundation of the building. Foundations
for tall, heavy chimneys require special consideration.</p>

<p>Where the wall of the house is of solid masonry 12 inches or more
thick, the chimney may be offset and carried on corbels or masonry
brackets instead of being carried down to the ground. The offset
should not extend more than 8 inches from the face of the wall, each
course projecting not more than 1 inch, and should not be less than 12
inches high. Often the corbeling is started at the second- or third-floor
level so that the chimney is only one or two stories high.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 432px;">

<p class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 8.</span>&mdash;For structural safety the amount of offset must be limited so that
the center line, XY, of the upper flue will not fall beyond the center of the

</div>

<p>Chimneys in frame buildings should be built from the ground up or
should rest on the foundation or basement walls if of solid masonry 12
inches or more thick.</p>

<p>A chimney resting on or carried by wooden floors, beams, or brackets
or hung from wooden rafters (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7, <i>B</i></a>) is a fire hazard. Wood
framing shrinks, and beams supporting heavy loads deflect in time.
Sagging beams injure the walls and ceilings of the house and are apt to
crack the chimney, rendering it dangerous.</p>

<p class="caption4">Flue Linings</p>

<p>Although, to save expense, chimneys are built without flue lining,
those with linings are more efficient. When the flue is not lined, the
mortar and bricks directly exposed to the action of fuel gases disintegrate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">« 9 »</a></span>
This disintegration and that occurring from changes in
temperature frequently cause cracks in the masonry, thereby reducing
the draft. An unlined chimney is best if not plastered except at the
sloped section (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8, <i>A</i></a>). However, the vertical and horizontal joints
should be filled with mortar and struck smooth and flush with the wall.
Offsets or bends in flues (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>) should not be greater than 30&deg; with the
vertical. This slope can be obtained by offsetting or corbeling each
brick course only 1 inch.</p>

<p>Flue lining must withstand rapid fluctuations in temperature and
be resistant to the action of ordinary flue gases. The shapes used as
flue lining should be of fire-clay, with shells not less than five-eighths
of an inch thick, and should be vitrified. As a safeguard against over-burning
and brittleness, the lining should be tested by submersion in
water at room temperature for 24 hours, during which a quantity of
water weighing more than 3 percent of the dry weight of the lining
should not be absorbed. Place each length of flue lining in position,
setting it in cement mortar with the joint struck smooth on the inside,
and then lay the brick around it. If the lining is slipped down after
several courses of brick have been laid, the joints cannot be filled and
leakage is almost sure to result. Fill any spaces between the lining
and the brickwork completely with mortar, especially if the round
type of flue is used.</p>

<p>The lower section of flue lining, unless resting on solid masonry at
the bottom of the flue, should be supported on at least three sides by
brick courses projecting to the inside surface of the lining. When
laying brick and lining, it is advisable to draw up a tight-fitting bag of
straw as the work progresses so as to catch material that might fall
and block the flue.</p>

<p>Where offsets or bends are necessary in lined flues, tight joints can
be made by mitering or cutting equally the ends of abutting sections
(<a href="#fig8">fig. 8, <i>B</i></a>). This can be done if a cement sack of damp sand is stuffed
firmly into the lining and a sharp chisel is tapped with a light hammer
along the line where the cut is desired. If the cutting is done after
the lining is built into the chimney, the lining may be broken and fall
out of place. The hole for the thimble can be cut the same way when
a special thimble section is not used.</p>

<p>The linings commonly used are rectangular or round. Rectangular
linings are better adapted to brick construction than round linings, but
the latter are considered more efficient. The sizes commonly used are
indicated in <a href="#Table_2">table 2</a>.</p>

<p class="caption4">Wall Thickness</p>

<p>Walls of chimneys not more than 30 feet high when lined should be
4 inches thick if of brick and reinforced concrete, 8 inches if of hollow
building units, and 12 inches if of stone. Linings may be omitted in
chimneys having walls of reinforced concrete at least 6 inches thick or
of unreinforced concrete or brick at least 8 inches thick, although
lining is desirable in the case of brick construction. Also the outside
wall of a chimney exposed to the weather is best made at least 8 inches
thick.</p>

<p>In chimneys containing three or more flues, building codes generally
require that each group of two flues be separated from the other single
flue or group of two flues by brick divisions or withes not less than
3&frac34; inches wide (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>) . Where two flues are grouped without divisions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span>
joints in the linings of adjacent flues are safer if staggered at least 7
inches, and particular care should be taken to have all joints filled
with mortar. Individual flues are advisable for fireplaces and heating
furnaces or boilers.</p>

<p class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 9.</span>&mdash;Cross section of chimney showing
the proper arrangement for three flues.
The division wall should be well bonded
with the side walls by staggering the
joints of successive courses. Note the
studs are kept 2 inches away from the
brickwork for reasons explained on
<a href="#Page_14">page 14</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>When two or more flues are used in unlined chimneys, they must be
separated by well-bonded withes 8 niches thick. An attractive and
effective method of separating unlined flues in colonial times is shown
in <a href="#fig10">figure 10</a>.</p>

<p>Chimneys extending above the roof are exposed to the wind and
may sway enough during a gale to open up the mortar joints at the
roof line. Openings in a flue at this point are especially dangerous
because sparks from the flue may come in contact with the woodwork
of the roof. It is therefore good practice to make the upper walls 8
inches thick (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>) by starting to offset the bricks just below the
intersection with the roof.</p>

<p>The brickwork around all fireplaces and flues should be laid with
cement mortar, as it is more resistant than lime mortar to the action
of heat and flue gases. A good mortar to use in setting flue linings
and all chimney masonry, except firebrick, consists of 1 part portland
cement, 1 part hydrated lime, and 6 parts clean sand, measured by
volume. Slacked-lime putty may be used in place of hydrated
lime; firebrick is best laid in fire-clay.</p>

<p class="caption4">Openings Into the Chimney</p>

<p>No range, stove, fireplace, or ventilating register should be connected
with the flue being used for the heating apparatus because this
is a frequent cause of unsatisfactory operation. Fires may occur
from sparks passing into one flue opening and out through another
where there are two connections to the same flue. If an abandoned
fireplace chimney is to be used for a range or stove, close the fireplace
flue tight about a foot below the smoke pipe hole.</p>

exposed upper section of a chimney
with 8-inch walls. Also the mortar
joint, in which the counter-flashing
is embedded, is not so likely to fail
as it is when the wall is only 4 inches
thick.</p>
</div>

<p>Gas-fired house heaters and built-in unit heaters, if not connected
to a masonry chimney, may be connected to flues of corrosion-resistant
sheet metal not lighter than 20-gage, properly insulated with asbestos
or other fireproofing material that will comply with the recommendations
of the Underwriter's Laboratories, Inc. Such flues should
extend through the roof.</p>

<p>A soot pocket<a name="FNanchor_2_5" id="FNanchor_2_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_5" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> is desirable for each flue. Deep pockets permit the
accumulation of soot, which may take fire; therefore start them from
a point preferably not more than 8 inches below the center line of the
smoke pipe intake and fill the lower part of the chimney with solid
masonry instead of extending the pocket to the base of the chimney
as is often done. Clean-out doors are necessary at the bottom of
deep pockets and, if used, must fit snugly and be kept tightly closed
so that air cannot get in. Clean-outs should serve only one flue, for
if two or more flues are connected with the same clean-out, air drawn
from one to another affects the draft in all of them. Sometimes a
door is placed just below the smoke pipe, but one is not really necessary
since the pipe, if taken down each year for cleaning, allows
removal of soot from shallow pockets through the pipe hole.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_5" id="Footnote_2_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_5"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> See soot pockets and clean-out doors in figures 12 and 35, pp. 13 and 38, respectively.</p>

<p>Close pipe holes, when temporarily not in use, with tight-fitting
metal flue stops; but, if a pipe hole is to be abandoned, fill it with
bricks laid in good mortar. This stopping can be readily removed.
The practice of closing a pipe hole with papered tin is dangerous, for
if there is another stove connected with the flue, the metal may
become hot enough to scorch the unprotected wallpaper or even set
it afire.</p>

<p>Proper care in setting and looking after pipe at its connection with
the chimney will greatly lessen the number of fires chargeable to
defective construction. Fit the pipe so that no opening will be left
around it, and keep it from projecting into the flue. The connection
can be made airtight with a closely fitting collar and boiler putty,
good cement mortar, or stiff clay.</p>

<p>Smoke pipes should enter the chimney horizontally, and the hole
through the chimney wall to the flue should be lined with fire-clay,
or metal thimbles should be securely and tightly built in the masonry.
Thimbles or flue rings can be had of 6-, 7-, 8-, 10-, and 12-inch diameters
and 6-, 9-, and 12-inch lengths. If the walls are furred
(<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>), the space between the thimbles and the wood furring should
be covered with metal lath and plaster.</p>

hazard that is frequently overlooked. <i>B</i>, Connection when plaster is applied

It should be as shown in <i>A</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>When a smoke pipe is less than 18 inches from woodwork, the woodwork
requires protection against charring. A metal casing or asbestos
board 2 inches from the upper half of the pipe is sometimes
employed to protect woodwork directly above it. A pipe, even so
protected, should never be closer than 9 inches to any woodwork or
other combustible material. Commercial fireproof pipe coverings
can be purchased.</p>

<p>If a pipe must be carried through a wood partition, protection for
the woodwork can be provided by cutting an opening in the partition
and inserting a galvanized-iron double-wall ventilating shield at
least 12 inches larger than the pipe (<a href="#fig12">fig. 13</a>) or by using at least 4
inches of brickwork or other incombustible material. Smoke pipes
should never pass through floors, closets, or concealed spaces or enter
a chimney in a garret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span></p>

<p>Gases formed by burning the sulfur contained in coal are the main
cause of corrosion of metal smoke pipes. Little corrosion occurs
during the heating season, when the pipe is kept hot and dry.</p>

<p>The life of metal pipes can be prolonged if each summer when they
are not in use they are taken down, cleaned, wrapped in paper, and
stored in a dry place. This is especially true of pipe to heaters in
damp cellars.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption4">Insulation</p>

<p>No wood should be in contact with a chimney. Leave a space of 2
inches between the outside face of a chimney and all wooden beams
or joists except when 8 inches of masonry is used outside flue lining,
in which case the framing may be within one-half inch of the chimney
masonry. The space between the floor framing and the chimney
may be filled with porous, nonmetallic, incombustible material, such
as loose cinders. Brickwork, mortar, and concrete are not suitable.
Place the filling before the floor is laid, as it not only forms a fire stop
but prevents accumulation of shavings or other combustible material.
Subflooring may be laid within one-half inch of the masonry. Baseboards,
when fastened to plaster that is directly in contact with the
wall of a chimney, can be protected by a layer of fireproof material,
such as asbestos, at least one-eighth of an inch thick between the woodwork
and the plaster (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span></p>

<p>Wooden studding, furring, or lathing should not be placed against
a chimney but set back, as indicated in <a href="#fig9">figure 9</a>; or the plaster may be
applied directly to the masonry or to metal lath laid over the masonry.
The former is the better method, as settlement will not crack the
plaster. It is recommended that a coat of cement plaster be applied
directly upon the outside surfaces of masonry chimneys that are to
be incased by a wooden partition or other combustible construction.
Metal lath, lapped 6 inches on the masonry, at the intersection of
chimneys with partitions prevents corner cracks. (See plan in <a href="#fig34">fig. 34</a>.)</p>

<p class="caption4">Chimney and Roof Connection</p>

<p>Where the chimney passes through the roof, provide a 2-inch clearance
between the wood framing and masonry for fire protection and
for expansion due to temperature changes, settlement, or slight movement
of the chimney during heavy winds.</p>

<p>A feature, said to have originated in colonial Williamsburg as a
precaution against fire hazard, is to build the upper section of outside
chimneys 18 inches to 2 feet away from the gable ends of the house
(<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>). This is not only a safety factor but a practical one because
the chimney can be more easily flashed, small windows can be used in
the walls of upper story rooms behind the chimney, and framing the
roof is simplified.</p>

<p class="caption4">Capping the Chimney</p>

<p>Various methods of terminating chimneys are shown in figures <a href="#fig11">11</a>
and <a href="#fig18">18</a>. Whatever one is used should be architecturally acceptable,
effective in preventing disintegration, and so made as to keep water
out of the flue.</p>

A section through the cricket is also shown. Note how counter-flashing is built

</div>

<p>It is advisable to project the flue lining 4 inches above the cap or
top course of brick and surround it with at least 2 inches of cement
mortar finished with a straight or concave slope to direct air currents
upward at the top of the flue; the sloped mortar also serves to drain
water from the top of the chimney. (See <a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>.) Hoods are commonly
used to keep rain out of a chimney (<a href="#fig18">fig. 18, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i></a>). The
area of the hood openings should be at least equal to the area of the
flue and each flue should have a separate hood. Concrete and brick
caps are usually made 4 inches thick, and it is advisable to project
them an inch or two to form a drip ledge.</p>

<p>Many of the chimneys built today are unsightly and frequently
detract from an otherwise well-designed house. Within the last 100
years the size and attractiveness of chimneys ordinarily built has
declined. The large old chimneys of colonial days were proportioned
to suit the house and surroundings and at the same time provide for
two or more large fireplaces. With reduction in the size of fireplaces
and the substitution of several stoves and eventually one central
heating plant, the chimney has developed into a merely utilitarian
shaft.</p>

<p class="caption4">Spark Arresters</p>

<p>Spark arresters are desirable and, where chimneys are near combustible
roofs, lumber, forests, etc., they are sometimes required, depending
on the kind of fuel, waste materials, or refuse that may be burned
and the amount of deposits that may accumulate in the flues. While
arresters cannot be depended on to eliminate entirely the discharge
of sparks under all conditions; yet, when properly built and installed,
they materially reduce spark hazard.<a name="FNanchor_4_7" id="FNanchor_4_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_7" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

by the National Fire Protection Association.</p></div>

<p>In general all parts, whether of wire, expanded metal, or perforated
sheets, give longer service if they are of rust-resistant material. Arresters
for domestic purposes should have vertical sides extending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span>
upward not less than 9 inches so as to provide a gross area of surface
at least twice the net flue area. They should be kept outside of the
flue area and be securely anchored to the chimney top.</p>

<p>Openings in the screen not larger than five-eights of an inch nor
smaller than five-sixteenths of an inch are advisable. Commercially
made screens can be purchased which generally last several years.
Arresters must be kept adjusted in position and renewed when the
openings are worn larger than the normal screen openings.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="Estimating_brick" name="Estimating_brick"></a>ESTIMATING BRICK</p>

<p>The number of standard-size brick (8 by 3&frac34; by 2&frac14; inches) required
to build a straight chimney having only two or three flues can be
estimated by drawing the flue lining to scale and then drawing lines
4 inches to 8 inches outside of the lining depending on the thickness of
the brick walls. Lay out 4- by 8-inch rectangles in the space between
the lining and the outside lines to determine how many brick are
needed per course.</p>

<p>For example, 15&frac12; brick are needed for each course of the chimney
in <a href="#fig9">figure 9</a>. Assuming the height is 30 feet and one-half-inch mortar
joints are used, also that there are 4&frac12; courses per foot, there would be
135 courses. Therefore, 135 multiplied by 15&frac12; equals 2,092 brick;
about 100 more will be needed to make the lower portion solid, or
2,200 brick in all.</p>

<p>A more general method of estimating that is applicable to more
complex structures is given on <a href="#Page_43">page 43</a>. Methods of determining the
quantity of mortar materials, labor, and cost are also given and can be
applied to this example.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Smoke_test" name="Smoke_test"></a>SMOKE TEST</p>

<p>Every flue should be subjected to the following smoke test before
the heater is connected with it and preferably before the chimney has
been furred and plastered or otherwise enclosed. Build a paper,
straw, wood, or tar-paper fire at the base of the flue. When the smoke
is rising in a dense column, tightly block the outlet at the top of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span>
chimney with a wet blanket. Smoke that escapes through the
masonry indicates the location of leaks. Frequently this test reveals
bad leaks into adjoining flues or directly through the walls or between
the linings and the wall. Remedy defects before the chimney is
accepted for use. Such defects are usually difficult to correct; hence
it is wise to watch the construction closely as it progresses.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Cleaning_and_repairing_flues" name="Cleaning_and_repairing_flues"></a>CLEANING AND REPAIRING FLUES</p>

<p>Chimneys develop defects which if not promptly repaired cause
trouble. Most masonry requires replacement of worn or weathered
material or repointing of mortar joints, while flues become clogged and
flashings fail.</p>

<p>It is advisable to test a chimney every few years for tightness by the
smoke test just described; to examine the inside of the flues by lowering
a lantern or flashlight on a strong cord down from the top of the
chimney or by holding a hand mirror at the proper angle at a stovepipe
hole; to inspect the masonry for loose units, which are most likely to
occur at the top (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>) where the action of the flue gases, especially
when soft coal is burned, disintegrates the mortar; to test mortar
joints from the outside by prodding with a knife or similar tool to
determine if the mortar is loose clear through the joint so as to leave
a hole; and to notice if the chimney is damp because of leaky flashings,
absorption of moisture from the ground, condensation, or excessive
rain entering the flues.</p>

<p class="caption4">Cleaning</p>

<p>Bricks that fall from the top and lodge at offsets or contracted
sections can sometimes be reached and dislodged by a long pole or
sections of pipe screwed together. They can be caught on a shingle
or piece of sheet metal shoved into a stovepipe hole or removed
through a clean-out door. A weighted cement sack filled with straw
and attached to the end of a rope may be pulled up and down the flue
to remove soot and loose material if the offset is not too great.</p>

<p>Trouble with creosote and soot can be reduced when one understands
how they are formed. Smoke and soot are caused by imperfect
combustion, usually due to one or all of the following conditions: (1)
Lack of sufficient air to the fire; (2) improper mixture of air with
furnace gases; (3) low furnace temperature; (4) too small combustion
space so that the gases reach the comparatively cool furnace surface
before they are completely burned and, as a result, soot or tarry matter
condenses and then passes up the chimney in the form of smoke. Soft
coal causes more soot trouble than hard coal.</p>

<p>If soot accumulates fast or trouble is experienced with unusual smoke
when firing, it is probable that the heating equipment is not being
operated properly. The manufacturer or installer usually is able to
suggest proper adjustments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span></p>

<p>Investigations by the United States Bureau of Mines<a name="FNanchor_5_8" id="FNanchor_5_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_8" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> have shown
that various materials on being burned or volatilized form a vapor or
smoke which settles upon soot; causing it to ignite at a lower temperature
and burn more easily. For soot to burn, the gases in contact
with it must have a temperature high enough to ignite it and sufficient
air to support the combustion. The effectiveness of burning varies
with the composition of the remover, but it also depends upon conditions
being favorable. It will usually reduce somewhat the soot in a
furnace and smoke pipe but not in a chimney. It has no effect on the
ash mixed with the soot. This ash not only does not burn, but prevents
complete burning of the soot mixed with it.</p>

OR COMPOUNDS. U. S. Bur. Mines Bul. 360, 76 pp., illus. 1932.</p></div>

<p>Soot removers cause soot to burn and are fire hazards. The correct
and most thorough method of cleaning a chimney is to do so manually
or to employ modern exhaust or vacuum methods used by furnace
repairmen. However, it is inconvenient to remove soot and ash
accumulations thoroughly more than once a year; hence a remover
may help to keep the passages of stoves and heaters clear between
annual cleanings, if deposits of soot accumulate quickly and reduce
the draft.</p>

<p>Likelihood of success in cleaning is greater when the deposits of soot
are thick, provided they do not cut down the draft too much. If
burning is employed, there is less risk when it is done frequently
enough to prevent large accumulations, which cause intense fires.
Also, freeing the heater and pipe of soot permits better fuel burning
and higher temperatures in the chimney flue, thus reducing the
amount of soot likely to be deposited on the flue walls.</p>

<p>Common salt (rock or ice-cream salt) is not the most effective
remover, yet it is the most widely used because of its cheapness, ease
of handling, and general availability. Use two or three teacupfuls per
application. Metallic zinc in the form of dust or small granules is
often used; however, a mixture of salt and 10 percent zinc dust is more
effective than either salt or zinc alone.</p>

<p>One of the most effective mixtures of materials readily available is
1 part dry red lead and 5 parts common salt, measured by weight.
Shake these together in a can with a tight-fitting lid. As lead is
poisonous, wash the hands after using. One or two teacupfuls are
used per application.</p>

<p>Old dry-cell batteries contain suitable ingredients and when they
are thrown in a hot furnace the soot usually burns. Quicker action
can be had if they are chopped up.</p>

<p>Before a remover is used, the fire must be put in good condition with
a substantial body of hot fuel on top. Close the ash-pit door and the
slots in the firing door and scatter the remover on the hot coals. Close
the firing doors and at once reduce the draft by partially closing the
pipe dampers. The draft should not be closed so tight as to cause
fumes to escape into the cellar. Let the remover "stew" for 10 to 20
minutes or until fumes stop rising from the coals; then make the fire
burn fiercely by opening the ash-pit door and the damper. Shaking
ashes out will help. The slots in the firing door can be opened or the
door itself set ajar. If soot in the furnace will not ignite, throw a
little wood or paper on the fire.</p>

<p>Instead of making a special job of cleaning at intervals, one or two
cups of salt may be thrown on the fire once a day with the expectation
that the furnace will produce a high enough temperature to ignite
some of the soot. This is most likely to succeed in cold weather when
the furnace temperatures are high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span></p>

<p class="caption4">Cause of Creosote</p>

<p>Creosote is the result of condensation in the chimney, and trouble
from this source is best avoided by preventing creosote formation.
It is more likely to form when wood is used for fuel than when coal is
burned and is more likely to form in cold than in mild climates.
Green wood may contain as high as 40 percent water, and dry wood
15 to 20 percent. When wood is slowly burned, it gives off acetic and
pyroligneous acid, which in combination with water or moisture form
creosote. When the draft is strong and an active fire is maintained,
much of the creosote is carried off into the atmosphere. The trouble
is aggravated when the fire does not burn briskly and when an outside
flue is subjected to chilling blasts. The walls of the chimney, being
comparatively cool, cause condensation of the vapors contained in the
smoke. Thus the creosote condenses and runs down the flue, finding
its way out of any joints that are not perfectly tight. The formation
of creosote is unusual in chimneys that are surrounded by warm rooms.
The outer walls of a chimney in an outside wall should be at least two
bricks thick and the chimney should have a good flue lining.</p>

<p>Creosote is difficult to remove and when it ignites makes a very hot
fire that is likely to crack the masonry and char adjacent timbers.
The only safe method of removal is to chip it from the masonry with a
blade or straightened-out hoe attached to a pipe or handle. A heavy
chain drawn up and down the flue walls is sometimes effective. However,
when creosote is removed, care is necessary not to knock out
mortar joints or to break the flue lining.</p>

<p>Large quantities of salt thrown on the fire in the grate or fireplace
will extinguish a chimney fire. A fire in a fireplace flue can be checked
in its intensity and frequently extinguished by first quenching the fire
on the hearth and then holding a wet rug or blanket over the opening
so as to shut off the air. When this is done, the soot and creosote are
likely to slide from the flue walls and drop into the fireplace. Before
extinguishing a fire in a flue, cover openings into the rooms, so that the
soot will not spread over furnishings.</p>

<p class="caption4">Repairing Chimneys</p>

<p>When a chimney is damp, examine the flashing at the junction with
the roof, especially if wet spots appear on the ceilings of rooms.
Methods of repairing flashing are given in Farmers' Bulletin 1751,
Roof Coverings for Farm Buildings and Their Repair. If the flashing
is sound, possibly water runs down the inside of the flue and through
defective mortar joints. Where these cannot be reached readily, the
chimney may have to be torn down and rebuilt. Sometimes a hood
(<a href="#fig18">fig. 18, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i></a>) is built on top of the chimney to keep out water or
to prevent wind blowing down it. To prevent dampness being drawn
up from the ground, the mortar can be raked from a joint at least
12 inches above the ground and a layer of slate, asbestos shingles, or
rust-resistant sheet metal and new mortar worked into the joint.
This work should be done by a mason. If bricks are porous or eroded,
raking out the mortar one-half of an inch deep and applying three-fourths
of an inch of cement plaster to the surfaces is effective. Eroded
joints in the rest of the masonry should be raked and repointed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span>
Where natural gas is burned, dampness due to condensation is not
unusual and a drain may be needed. Where such conditions exist,
advice should be sought from the manufacturers of the equipment
as to the proper remedy.</p>

<p>A chimney that becomes too hot to permit holding the hand against
it should be carefully inspected by a reliable mason and adequately
protected as suggested in the preceding pages.</p>

<p>If, after a chimney is cleaned, an examination discloses holes, unfilled
joints, or other unsound conditions out of reach for repair, it
is advisable to tear the masonry down and rebuild properly. Inside
bricks that are impregnated with creosote and soot should not be
used in the new work because they will stain plaster whenever dampness
occurs. It is almost impossible to remove creosote and soot
stains on plaster and wallpaper. Sometimes painting the plaster with
aluminum-flake paint or waterproof varnish hides the stains.</p>

<p>A hatchway cut through a roof is convenient when high chimneys
are repaired or cleaned, especially when access to the roof is difficult.
The hatchway should be located so that it will not be necessary to
crawl over the roof to reach the chimney and so that a ladder placed
on the attic floor will not be too steep for safe ascent. A watertight
cover with hooks to prevent its blowing off is essential. Such a
hatchway is best provided when the building is erected but can be
readily built at any time.</p>


<hr class="chap" />


<p class="caption2"><a name="Fireplaces" id="Fireplaces">FIREPLACES</a></p>

<p>A fireplace is ordinarily considered appropriate to a living room,
dining room, and bedroom; however, basement, porch, and outdoor
fireplaces are gaining in favor with the householder. Also public
dining places, offices, etc., frequently have fireplaces for the comfort
and for the air of informality they provide.</p>

<p>All fireplaces should be built in accordance with the few simple
essentials of correct design given herein if satisfactory performance
is to be realized. They should be of a size best suited to the room in
which they are used from the standpoint of appearance and operation.
If too small, they may function properly but do not throw out sufficient
heat. If they are too large, a fire that would fill the combustion
chamber would be entirely too hot for the room and would waste fuel.</p>

<p>The location of the chimney determines the location of the fireplace
and too often is governed by structural considerations only. A
fireplace suggests a fireside group and a reasonable degree of seclusion,
and therefore, especially in the living room, it should not be near
doors to passageways of the house.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Characteristics" name="Characteristics"></a>CHARACTERISTICS</p>

<p>The principal warming effect of a fireplace is produced by the radiant
heat from the fire and from the hot back, sides, and hearth. In the
ordinary fireplace practically no heating effect is produced by convection,
that is, by air current. Air passes through the fire and up the
chimney, carrying with it the heat absorbed from the fire; at the same
time outside air of a lower temperature is drawn into the room. The
effect of the cold air thus brought into the room is particularly noticeable
farthest from the fire. Heat radiation, like light, travels in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span>
straight lines, and unless one is within range of such radiation, little
heat is felt. Tests made by the Bureau of Agricultural Chemistry
and Engineering showed that about five times the amount of air required
for even liberal ventilation may be drawn into a living room
by the operation of a fireplace. Such excessive ventilation may cause
chilling drafts. Persons located at advantageous points in the room
will be comfortable under such conditions, but those out of the radiation
zone will not.</p>

<p class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 19.</span>&mdash;In 1744 Franklin promoted a metal fireplace of this type to be set
out into a room. These are known as Franklin stoves and sometimes are
equipped with andirons for burning wood or a grate for burning coal. The
metal blower, shown in front of the opening was used with grates and set in
place when starting the draft and then removed so that the cheery heat of
glowing coals could be enjoyed. At one time this type of stove was highly
thought of because it threw out more heat than the built-in fireplace. A few
manufacturers specialize in Franklin stoves because of the present-day demand.</p>
</div>

<p>Tests conducted by this Bureau indicate that, as ordinarily constructed,
a fireplace is only about one-third as efficient as a good stove
or circulator heater. Nevertheless, they have a place as an auxiliary
to the heating plant and for their cheerfulness and charm. In milder
climates, fireplaces may suffice as the sole source of heat; also certain
materials often wasted may be utilized for fuel. The disadvantages of
the ordinary fireplace are lessened by "modified" fireplaces.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="Modified_fireplaces" name="Modified_fireplaces"></a>MODIFIED FIREPLACES</p>

<p>The Franklin stove (<a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>) is a type of modified fireplace.</p>

<p>The modified fireplaces of today are of several types, as shown in
figures <a href="#fig20">20</a> and <a href="#fig21">21</a>.</p>

<p>Both the last two types of modified fireplaces are manufactured as
units of heavy metal, designed to be set into place and concealed by
the usual brickwork, or other construction, so that no practical
change in mantel design is required by their use. The modifications
are built-in standard parts of the fireplace&mdash;only the grilles show (<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>).</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 468px;">

heated as it rises by natural circulation through the back chamber, <i>c</i>, and the
tubes, <i>t</i>, being discharged into the room from the register, <i>b</i>. Air for supporting
combustion is drawn into the fire at <i>d</i> and passes between the tubes up the flue
A damper is also provided to close the air inlet.</p>
</div>

<p>One advantage claimed for modified fireplace units is that the correctly
designed and proportioned firebox, manufactured with throat,
damper, smoke shelf, and chamber, provides a form for the masonry,
thus reducing the risk of failure and assuring a smokeless fireplace!
However, there is no excuse for using incorrect proportions; and the
desirability of using a foolproof form, as provided by the modified
unit, merely to obtain good proportions should be considered from the
standpoint of cost. Even though the unit is well designed, it will
not operate properly if the chimney is inadequate; therefore the rules
for correct chimney construction must be adhered to with the modified
unit as well as with the ordinary fireplace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">« 25 »</a></span></p>

<p>Manufacturers claim labor and materials saved tend to offset the
purchase price of the unit; also that the saving in fuel justifies any
net increase in first cost. A minimum life of 20 years is claimed for
the type and thickness of metal commonly used today in these units.</p>

<p>Field tests made by this Bureau have proved that, when properly
installed, the better designs of modified-fireplace units circulate heat
into the cold corners of rooms and will deliver heated air through
ducts to adjoining or upper rooms. For example, heat could be
diverted to a bathroom from a living-room fireplace.</p>

<p class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 21.</span>&mdash;In this fireplace the air is not drawn in directly from outdoors but
through the inlet, <i>a</i>, from the room that is being heated. The air is heated by
contact with the metal sides and back of the fireplace, rises by natural circulation,
and is discharged back into the room from the outlet, <i>b</i>, or to another room
on the same floor or in the second story. The inlets and outlets are connected
to registers which may be located at the front of the fireplace, as shown in
<a href="#fig22">figure 22</a>. The registers may be located on the ends of the fireplace or on the
wall of an adjacent room.</p>
</div>

<p>The quantity and temperature of the heated air discharged from the
grilles in figures <a href="#fig20">20</a> and <a href="#fig21">21</a> were measured to determine the merits of the
convection features. These measurements showed that very appreciable
amounts of convected heat are produced by the modified unit
when properly installed and operated. Discharge-air temperatures
in excess of 200&deg; F. were attained from some of the units tested. The
heated air delivered from the discharge grilles of some of the medium-sized
units represented a heating effect equivalent to that from
nearly 40 square feet of cast-iron radiation of the ordinary hot-water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span>
heating system, or sufficient to heat a 15- by 18-foot room built with
average tightness to 70&deg; F. when the outside temperature is 40&deg; F.
Additional convected heat can be produced with some models by the
use of forced-circulation fans.</p>

<p class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 22.</span>&mdash;Except for the registers and metallic sides and back, the appearance
of modified fireplaces is like that of ordinary ones. An interesting effect
is secured by the mirror&mdash;the reflection of the opposite wall appears like a
recess over the mantel.</p>
</div>

<p>However, the nature of operation, with the unavoidably large quantity
of heated air passing up the stack, makes the inherent over-all
efficiency of any fireplace relatively low. Therefore, claims for an
increased efficiency of modified fireplaces should be understood merely
as constituting an improvement over the ordinary fireplace and not
over stoves or central heating plants.</p>

<p>When a fireplace is being selected the kind of fuel to be burned
should be considered; also, the design should harmonize with the room
in proportion and detail (figs. <a href="#fig23">23</a> and <a href="#fig24">24</a>).</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 468px;">

<p class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 23.</span>&mdash;A well-designed commercial mantel that suits the room. Since it
is painted the same color as the walls, it does not focus attention, as the handsomely
carved formal mantel or mahogany shown in <a href="#fig37">figure 37</a> is intended to do.</p>
</div>

<p>In colonial days, when cordwood was plentiful, fireplaces 7 feet wide
and 5 feet high were common, especially when used in kitchens for
cooking (<a href="#fig25">fig. 25</a>). They required large amounts of fuel and too frequently
were smoky.</p>

<p>Where cordwood (4 feet long) is cut in half, a 30-inch width is
desirable for a fireplace; but, where coal is burned, the opening can
be narrower (<a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>). Thirty inches is a practical height for the
convenient tending of a fire where the width is less than 6 feet; openings
about 30 inches wide (<a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>) are generally made with square
corners. The higher the opening, the greater the chance of a smoky
fireplace.</p>

<p class="fig_caption">Figure 26.&mdash;Fireplaces originally intended for wood were frequently bricked up,
and small cast-iron units of this type were built in, since the large openings
required for wood were wasteful when coal was used. This was a very popular
type of grate for hotel and private bedrooms about 1860 and can still be seen
in old houses in coal regions. Note the plain and neat mantel of wide plank.</p>
</div>

<p>In general, the wider the opening the greater should be the depth.
A shallow opening throws out relatively more heat than a deep one
of the same width but accommodates smaller pieces of wood; thus it
becomes a question of preference between a greater depth which permits
the use of large logs that burn longer and a shallower depth
(<a href="#fig28">fig. 28, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i></a>) which takes smaller-sized wood but throws out more
heat.</p>

<p>In small fireplaces a depth of 12 inches will permit good draft if
the throat is constructed as explained above, but a minimum depth of
16 to 18 inches is advised to lessen the danger of brands falling out on
the floor.</p>

<p>As a rule, fireplaces on the second floor are smaller than those on
the first floor and it is well to follow this practice because the flue
height is less for second floor fireplaces (<a href="#fig29">fig. 29</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">« 31 »</a></span></p>

<p>Unless a fireplace 6 feet wide is fully 28 inches deep, the logs will
have to be split, and some advantage of the wide opening will be lost.</p>

<p>Screens of suitable design should be placed in front of all fireplaces
(<a href="#fig30">fig. 30</a>).</p>

from table 3 for the width selected.</p>

<p>The ordinary fireplace is constructed generally as shown in <a href="#fig34">figure
34</a>. It is essential (1) that the flue have the proper area, (2) that
the throat be correctly constructed and have suitable damper, (3) that
the chimney be high enough for a good draft, (4) that the shape of the
fireplace be such as to direct a maximum amount of radiated heat
into the room, and (5) that a properly constructed smoke chamber be
provided.</p>

<p><a href="#Table_3">Table 3</a> gives recommended dimensions for fireplaces of various
widths and heights.</p>

<p>If a damper is installed, the width of the opening j, <a href="#fig34">figure 34</a>, will
depend on the width of the damper frame, the size of which is fixed
by the width and depth of the fireplace and the slope of the back wall.
The width of the throat proper is determined by the opening of the
hinged damper cover. The full damper opening should never be less
than the flue area. Responsible manufacturers of fireplace equipment
give valuable assistance in the selection of a suitable damper for
a given fireplace. A well-designed and well-installed damper should
be regarded as essential in cold climates.</p>

<p>When no damper is used, the throat opening j should be 4 inches
for fireplaces not exceeding 4 feet in height.</p>

dropped into a pit below (<a href="#fig35">fig. 35</a>).</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 469px;">

<img src="images/fig_35.png" width="469" height="266" alt="" />
<p class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 35.</span>&mdash;The ash-pit should be of tight masonry and should be provided with
a tightly fitting iron clean-out door and frame about 10 by 12 inches in size.
A clean-out for the furnace flue as shown is sometimes provided.</p>
</div>

<p>In buildings with wooden floors the hearth in front of the fireplace
should be supported by masonry trimmer arches (<a href="#fig34">fig. 34</a>) or other
fire-resistant construction. Hearths should project at least 16 inches
from the chimney breast and should be of brick, stone, terra cotta, or
reinforced concrete not less than 4 inches thick. The length of the
hearth should be not less than the width of the fireplace opening plus
16 inches. Wooden centering under trimmer arches may be removed
after the mortar has set, though it is more frequently left in place.
<a href="#fig36">Figure 36</a> shows a recommended method of floor framing around a
fireplace.</p>

<p class="caption4">Wall Thickness</p>

<p>The walls of fireplaces should never be less than 8 inches thick, and
if of stone they should be at least 12 inches thick. When built of
stone or hard-burned brick, the back and sides are often not lined with
firebrick, but it is better to use firebrick laid in fire-clay. When
firebricks are laid fiat with the long sides exposed there is less danger
of their falling out. They are generally placed on edge, however,
forming a 2-inch protection, in which case metal ties should be built
into the main brickwork to hold the 2-inch firebrick veneer in place.
Thick metal backs and sides are sometimes used as lining. When a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">« 39 »</a></span>
grate for burning coal or coke is built in, firebrick at least 2 inches
thick should be added to the fireplace back unless the grate has a
solid iron back and is only set in with an air space behind it (<a href="#fig37">fig. 37</a>).</p>

<p class="caption4">Jambs</p>

<p>The jambs should be wide enough to give stability and a pleasing
appearance; they are frequently faced with ornamental brick or tile.
For an opening 3 feet wide or less, a 12- or 16-inch width is generally
sufficient, depending on whether a wood mantel is used or the jambs
are of exposed masonry. The edges of a wood mantel should be kept
at least 8 inches from the fireplace opening. For wider openings and
large rooms, similar proportions should be kept.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 258px;">
<a name="fig36" id="fig36"></a>
<img src="images/fig_36.png" width="258" height="260" alt="" />
<p class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 36.</span>&mdash;Where a header is more than 4 feet in length, it should be doubled,
as shown. Headers supporting more than four tail beams should have ends
supported in metal joist hangers. The framing may be placed one-half inch
from the chimney because the masonry is 8 inches thick.</p>
</div>

<p class="caption4">Lintel</p>

<p>Lintels of &frac12;- by 3-inch flat iron bars. 3&frac12;- by 3&frac14;- by &frac14;-inch angle
irons, or damper frames are used to support the masonry over the
opening of ordinary fireplaces. Heavier lintel irons are required for
wider openings.</p>

<p>Where a masonry arch (<a href="#fig38">fig. 38</a>) is used over the opening, the jambs
should be heavy enough to resist the thrust of the arch. Arches over
openings less than 4 feet wide seldom sag, but sagging is not uncommon
in wider fireplaces, especially where massive masonry is used.</p>

<p class="caption4">Throat</p>

<p>The sides of the fireplace should be vertical up to the throat, or
damper opening (<i>ff</i> <a href="#fig34">fig. 34</a>). The throat should be 6 to 8 inches or
more above the bottom of the lintel and have an area not less than
that of the flue and a length equal to the width of the fireplace opening.
Starting 5 inches above the throat, <i>ee</i>, the sides should be drawn in at
<i>tt</i> to equal the flue area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">« 40 »</a></span></p>

<p>Proper throat construction is so necessary to a successful fireplace
that the work should be inspected several times a day during construction
to make certain that the side walls are carried up perpendicularly
until the throat is passed and that the full length of opening is provided.</p>

<p class="caption4">Smoke Shelf and Chamber</p>

<p>The smoke shelf is made by setting the brickwork back at the top
of the throat to the line of the flue wall for the full length of the
throat. Its depth may vary from 6 to 12 inches or more, depending on
the depth, d, of the fireplace.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 464px;">

<p class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 37.</span>&mdash;Grates of this type are commonly used in fireplaces for burning
coal or coke. This one has a metal back and ends and is only set in to permit
proper circulation of air around it.</p>
</div>

<p>The smoke chamber is the space extending from the top of the
throat, <i>ee</i>, up to the bottom of the flue proper, tt, and between the side
walls. The walls should be drawn inward 30&deg; to the vertical after the
top of the throat, <i>ee</i>, is passed and smoothly plastered with cement
mortar not less than one-half inch thick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">« 41 »</a></span></p>

<p class="caption4">Damper</p>

<p>A properly designed damper, as shown in <a href="#fig34">figure 34</a>, affords a means
of regulating the draft and prevents excessive loss of heat from the
room when the fire is out. A damper consists of a cast-iron frame
with a lid hinged so that the width of the throat opening may be
varied from a closed to a wide-open position. Various patterns are
on the market, some designed to support the masonry over the opening,
others requiring lintel irons.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 463px;">
<a name="fig38" id="fig38"></a>
<img src="images/fig_38.png" width="463" height="337" alt="" />
<p class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 38.</span>&mdash;This well-designed small stone fireplace was built in accordance
with the principles given in this bulletin. It is a good heater and does not
smoke. The jambs are wide enough to resist the thrust of the arch.</p>
</div>

<p>A roaring pine fire may require a full-throat opening, but slow-burning
hardwood logs may need only 1 or 2 inches of opening.
Regulating the opening according to the kind of fire prevents waste
of heat up the chimney. Closing the damper in summer keeps flies,
mosquitoes, and other insects from entering the house down the
chimney.</p>

<p>In houses heated by furnaces or other modern systems, lack of a
damper in the fireplace flue may interfere with uniform heating, particularly
in very cold windy weather, whether or not there is a fire on
the hearth. When air heated by the furnace is carried up the chimney
there is a waste of the furnace fuel, but a damper partially open serves
a slow fire of hardwood without smoking the room or wasting heated
air from the main heating system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">« 42 »</a></span></p>

<p class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 39.</span>&mdash;Diagram showing front view and cross section of an entire chimney
such as is commonly built to serve a furnace, fireplace, and kitchen stove. Two
sets of dimensions are given, those in rectangles refer to the approximate sizes
of the voids or openings; the others refer to the outside dimensions of the brickwork.
These are used in estimating the number of bricks in a chimney. The
letters <i>A</i>-<i>F</i> indicate sections used in estimating the quantities of brick required
(See <a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>.)</p>
</div>

<p class="caption4">Flue</p>

<p>The area of lined flues should be a twelfth or more of the fireplace
opening, provided the chimney is at least 22 feet in height, measured
from the hearth. If the flue is shorter than 22 feet or if it is unlined,
its area should be made a tenth or more of the fireplace opening. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">« 43 »</a></span>
fireplace shown in <a href="#fig34">figure 34</a> has an opening of 7.5 square feet, or approximately
1,080 square inches, and needs a flue area of approximately
90 square inches; a rectangular flue, 8% by 18 inches, outside dimensions,
or a round flue with a 12-inch inside diameter might be used, as
these are the nearest commercial sizes of lining (<a href="#Table_2">table 2</a>). It is seldom
possible to obtain lining having exactly the required area, but the inside
area should never be less than that prescribed above. A 13- by
13-inch flue was selected for convenience when combining with the
other flues. If the flue is built of brick and is unlined, its area should
be approximately one-tenth of the fireplace opening, or 108 square
inches. It would probably be made 8 by 16 inches (128 square inches)
because brickwork can be laid to better advantage when the dimensions
of the flue are multiples of 4 inches. The principles of construction
given under Chimneys (<a href="#Page_7">p. 7</a>) apply to fireplace flues.</p>

<p><a href="#Table_4">Table 4</a> is convenient in selecting the proper size of flue or for determining
the size of fireplace opening for an existing flue. The area of
the fireplace opening in square inches is obtained by multiplying the
width, <i>w</i>, by the height, <i>h</i>, (<a href="#fig34">fig. 34</a>), both measured in inches.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Cost_estimate" name="Cost_estimate"></a>COST ESTIMATE</p>

<p>A convenient method for estimating the number of bricks in a chimney
is to calculate the volume of the various sections which differ in
outside dimensions and then subtract the voids or cavities resulting
from ash-pits, fireplace, and flues. This will be the total cubic feet of
brickwork which, when multiplied by 22.5, is converted to number of
bricks. For convenience, inches as indicated in <a href="#fig39">figure 39</a> have been
converted to decimals of a foot.<a name="FNanchor_6_9" id="FNanchor_6_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_6_9" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>When a fireplace smokes, it should be examined to make certain
that the essential requirements of construction as outlined in this
bulletin have been fulfilled. If the chimney is not stopped up with
fallen brick and the mortar joints are not loose, note whether nearby
trees or tall structures cause eddies down the flue. To determine
whether the fireplace opening is in correct proportion to the flue
area, hold a piece of sheet metal across the top of the fireplace opening
and then gradually lower it, making the opening smaller until smoke
does not come into the room. Mark at the lower edge of the metal
on the sides of the fireplace. The opening may then be reduced by
building in a metal shield or hood across the top so that its lower edge
is at the marks made during the test; or the trouble can generally be
remedied by increasing the height of the flue.</p>

<p>The tendency is to build too large an outdoor fireplace. Where
only a little cooking is to be done occasionally in a small yard or at a
picnic, several concrete blocks or stones set on the ground about 12
to 16 inches apart will serve. The shelf of an old refrigerator may be
used for a grille. If permanence is desired, the walls should be laid
in cement mortar and the fireplace should have a suitable foundation
and a permanent grille. An end wall is recommended to prevent
embers from being scattered by drafts blowing between the side walls.
Smoke annoyance while cooking is lessened by making the fireplace
long enough to permit a short chimney (<a href="#fig40">fig. 40</a>).</p>

<p>A circle of stones laid loosely on the surface, larger stones set partly
into the ground, or carefully laid masonry walls on a stable foundation
may be used for campfires and small barbecue parties. A cast-iron
pot with a lid can be buried in the ashes for baking. Pipe supports
for pots and pans built into the masonry are a convenience; they can
be homemade or purchased. Spits for roasting can be improvised
or bought.</p>

<p>Fireplaces opening onto an enclosed porch or paved terrace, are
often built as an integral part of the house chimney (<a href="#fig41">fig. 41</a>). The
corner of boundary walls permits effective treatment. Such fireplaces
should meet the regulations of local fire authorities and be
built with the same care and be subject to the same rules as inside
fireplaces.</p>

<p class="caption3"><a id="Obtaining_plans" name="Obtaining_plans"></a>OBTAINING PLANS</p>

<p>Plans for outdoor fireplaces are available from various publishing
houses; several magazines feature illustrations that can be adapted
to the material at hand. If a structure is to be built with local labor
and material, simple designs are advisable. The size of stones, joints,
and proportions have a direct influence upon appearance, and good
personal taste frequently results in more pleasing structures than
blind adherence to conventional designs. The various combinations
of ovens, cranes, grilles, storage compartments, benches, lights, sinks,
etc., to be used as built-in features affect the design. Before planning
a structure with these features, catalogs of dealers in outdoor fireplace
equipment should be consulted for sizes of the available accessories
so that ample space and proper details can be provided in the masonry
for building them in. Skilled labor should be employed for elaborate
designs (<a href="#fig42">fig. 42</a>) when much equipment is built in or when the fireplace,
as in <a href="#fig41">figure 41</a>, is an integral part of a permanent building.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 463px;">

<p class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 42.</span>&mdash;This fireplace, set at a focal point in the garden, enhances the
landscape. It was built by a skilled mason.</p>
</div>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Construction_48" name="Construction_48"></a>CONSTRUCTION</p>

<p>Ordinarily the fire is built on the hearth, no grate being used. Fire
regulations in hazardous localities may require firing doors, dampers,
spark screens, and a solid-plate cooking surface; otherwise these
features are not essential. Two and a half square feet of cooking
surface is desirable, while access to both sides and the end permit
several people to cook at the same time. The side walls should have
fairly level tops for pots and pans. Side walls are made 2 to 6 inches
higher than the cooking level to permit anchoring the grille; if too
high, they interfere with cooking. Commercial grilles are available,
but satisfactory ones can be made of &frac12;-inch to &frac34;-inch pipe or &#8541;-inch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">« 49 »</a></span>
reinforcing rods. The pipes should be 6 to 10 inches longer than the
width of the firebox; they should be spaced not more than 1&frac14; inches
apart and have their tops exactly level to prevent pots and pans from
wobbling. Two or three pipes can be used for a lintel over the opening
into the flue if regular iron lintels are not available. Where a
solid top is desired, it should be of boiler plate at least &frac14;-inch thick.
Such plates must be stiffened to prevent buckling by alternate heating
and cooling; for ordinary purposes they are merely set on top of the
grid though they may be hinged at the rear so they can be tipped
back against the chimney.</p>

<p>The best draft is secured when the fireplace faces the direction of
prevailing breezes and is protected from strong winds which might
scatter sparks. If the fireplace is built too near shrubbery or under
trees, the heat and smoke may damage or burn the foliage. A slight
rise or a gentle slope that affords good drainage should be selected.
Paving the ground around the fireplace, with flagstones or covering
it with a layer of gravel or sand will prevent the area from becoming
a mudhole or an unsightly bare spot; also, danger of starting brush
fires by sparks falling from the firebox is lessened.</p>

<p>Fireboxes 12 to 16 inches wide, 16 to 24 inches long, and 6 to 8
inches deep with the hearth at 9 to 16 inches above the ground are
sufficient for most purposes. Large fireboxes are wasteful of fuel;
while, if the grille is too high above the hearth, much of the best
cooking heat from glowing coals is lost. Most grilles are set 15 to 24
inches above the ground, though 30 inches may be desirable to avoid
the necessity of stooping when cooking. The hearth should slope
1 to 2 inches toward the front so that rain water will drain away.</p>

<p>The area of the chimney flue should be at least one-eighth the vertical
cross-sectional area of the firebox.</p>

<p>Fire-clay linings for the firebox and flue are not absolutely necessary
except when required by fire regulations or where hot fires are maintained
for long periods. They, or common brick linings, are advisable
for the more permanent and expensive structures or where it is necessary
to use porous stone, such as sandstone and most stratified rocks,
which absorb water and flake or chip upon exposure to fire.</p>

<p>Most rocks or stone that can be worked up without special tools
or skill, brick, and concrete are adaptable for the average fireplace
(<a href="#fig43">fig. 43</a>). The size of the stones determines the thickness of the
walls; no wall should be less than 8 inches thick.</p>

<p>Where suitable stone is difficult to get in sufficient quantity, the
exposed surface may consist of a shell the thickness of the stone and
the inner portion of the wall be made of concrete or large stone bedded
in concrete. When flue lining is necessary, it will serve as a form
for the flue: otherwise a metal stovepipe makes a practical form, or
the flue can be formed of brick laid on edge. The stones can be laid
and the concrete deposited with the least trouble by building the
veneer and flue only 6 to 8 inches high at one time. All masonry
should be laid in mortar, as described on <a href="#Page_10">page 10</a>. Concrete made in
the proportions 1:2&#189;:4 will serve most purposes where wall sections
are about 8 inches thick. For heavy foundations and thick walls not
subject to direct fire, 1:3:6 concrete is strong enough.</p>

<p>A concrete slab 4 to 8 inches thick with the bottom 4 to 6 inches
below the surface provides a sufficient foundation for medium-sized
structures where frost is negligible and the soil is well drained and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">« 50 »</a></span>
firm. If the soil is not well drained a 6- to 8-inch layer of stone,
cinders, or sand should be provided under the slab and the surface of
the immediate vicinity graded or otherwise protected from water.
It is advisable to use &frac14;-inch or &frac12;-inch reinforcing rods, 6 inches apart
in both directions, one-third the distance from the top in slabs for all
but the smallest fireplaces or where frost is not severe.</p>

sizes to suit the landscape; <i>B</i>, vertical-section sketch; <i>C</i>, the completed fireplace.
The stones for this fireplace were picked up at "the swimming hole." About
8 bushels were used over a backing of concrete; 16 bushels would have been
needed if the concrete had not been used. Gravel and sand were dug from
the excavation. The chimney is battered 4 inches in the 24-inch height.</p>
</div>

<p>Heavy and expensive structures, especially those having tall
chimneys, should have foundations below the surface affected by
frost or erosion and strong enough to prevent settlement or cracks.
Such a foundation can be made of concrete, with a liberal use of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">« 51 »</a></span>
large stones for economy, extending under the whole structure, or be
continuous walls with a footing similar to those used for houses. The
advice and help of builders may save money in the construction of
foundations of large expensive fireplaces, especially where climatic
conditions are severe and the bearing power of soil is not known.</p>


<p class="caption3"><a id="Operation" name="Operation"></a>OPERATION</p>

<p>Cooking should be done over glowing coals, as flames and smoke
smudge the utensils or even the food. When the wood is nearly
charred, most of the smoke has been driven off and the chimney is hot
enough to draw the smoke up the flue. All fires should be banked
before they are left, to avoid setting fires. Banking can be safely and
effectively done by raking the coals and unconsumed fuel into a pile
on the hearth and covering the pile with a few inches of earth. Water
thrown on a hot fire may result in scalds from the steam and may
crack the fireplace.</p>


<p class="caption2"><a id="Barbecue_pits" name="Barbecue_pits"></a>BARBECUE PITS</p>

<p>Barbecue ovens are rather expensive unless for community use.
Outdoor fireplaces, without or with spits for roasting, are frequently
called barbecues in some sections of the country. For occasional
barbecuing parties, a hole in the ground will serve. Dig a hole several
feet deep and several feet larger each way than the size of the carcass
to be roasted; then place stones in the bottom to retain the heat. A
trench 30 inches deep, 36 inches wide, and about 10 feet long will
accommodate about 400 pounds of beef. A fire should be built
sufficiently ahead of time, about 3 hours, to heat the stones and bottom
and accumulate ashes for proper banking. Have someone with previous
experience operate the pit, because improper wrapping of the
meat and handling of the coals results in poor cooking.</p>


<p class="caption2"><a id="Dutch_ovens" name="Dutch_ovens"></a>DUTCH OVENS</p>

<p>Dutch ovens (<a href="#fig25">fig. 25</a>) are often built in connection with both indoor
and outdoor fireplaces to copy early kitchen fireplaces or for actual
baking.</p>

<p>When used as an ornament, the oven is fitted with a cast-iron door,
and the space thus formed may be used for wood storage. An open
firebox or compartment below may be similarly used. Spaces used
for wood storage should be separated from the fireplace by a brick or
stone partition at least 8 inches thick, all joints being completely
filled with mortar.</p>

<p>If the oven is intended for baking, it is advisable to line it with
firebrick, and the masonry should be at least 8 inches thick. A greater
heat-storing capacity is secured by using thick walls. An ash drop
of standard cast-iron unit type is provided for modern ovens and may
lead either to the side of the fireplace or to an ash-pit in the chimney
base. The throat or dome should be carefully formed with brick
molded or ground to an arch and preferably should be fitted with a
damper. If the top of the oven is flat, several lintel irons will be
needed to support the brick. A separate flue with a damper is recommended.
For ovens of ordinary size an 8&#189;- by 8&#189;-inch flue is ample.
The oven is preheated by fire or hot coals. Before food is placed in
the oven, the coals and ashes are removed through the ash drop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">« 52 »</a></span></p>

<p>Figure 44 shows a Dutch oven made of tapered adobe bricks and
plastered outside with adobe mud. A hole in the top permits the
escape of smoke, while the orño is being heated by the fire built inside
on the floor. This hole is closed with an adobe block after the coals
are raked out. When loaves of bread have been placed on the floor
with a wooden paddle, the door hole is stopped with adobe brick.</p>

along the Mexican border. It is called an orño and is usually built a short
distance from the kitchen door.</p>
</div>

<p>Boy Scouts and campers frequently improvise Dutch ovens by
packing damp sandy clay, 8 to 12 inches thick, around a wooden barrel,
a tin wash boiler, or slabs of rock to form a vault. After the earth has
been gradually dried and baked with a slow fire, the oven is ready for
use. The hole in the top and the door can be closed as in the orño.</p>
